I am a PhD student in the Department of Information Science at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where I am advised by Prof. Nitin Agarwal.

My research explores the dynamics of collective action, the design and impact of information campaigns, and the role of social computing in shaping public discourse. I am particularly interested in how digital platforms facilitate or hinder group coordination, mobilization, and narrative formation. Drawing from computational social science, human-computer interaction, and communication studies, my work combines quantitative and qualitative methods to understand how people organize, engage, and influence one another in networked environments.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from the University of Burdwan in India. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Software Developer and Data Engineer for 6 years at companies including Cognizant and Accenture.

I am currently working as a Research Assistant at Collaboratorium for Social Media and Online Behavioral Studies (COSMOS) Research Center.

The research I am working on ("Developing Socio-computational Approaches to Mitigate Collective Action-based Socio-cognitive Security Threats in a Multi-platform Multimedia-rich Information Environment". PI: Dr. Nitin Agarwal) is funded by the U.S. Army Research Office (ARO) Social and Cognitive Networks Program.

My dissertation looks into contributing factors of a successful information campaign and socio-computational modelling of Collective Action.
