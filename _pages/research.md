My research focuses on **socio-computational approaches** to understanding **collective action**, **group behavior**, and **discourse dynamics** within the context of **social movements** and **information campaigns**. By integrating methods from computational social science, discourse analysis, and social network analysis, my work seeks to uncover how online interactions shape real-world mobilization, and narrative evolution.

The key themes of my research include:

- **Modeling Collective Action**: Understanding how individuals coordinate and mobilize online and offline in response to social, political, or ideological triggers.
- **Information Campaigns**: Analyzing the structure and effectiveness of strategic communication aimed at shaping public opinion or countering disinformation.
- **Group Behavior and Dynamics**: Studying how group identity, behavior norms, and engagement patterns evolve over time.
- **Discourse Analysis**: Investigating language, framing, and rhetorical strategies used within digital activism and political communication.
- **Social Network Analysis**: Mapping influence, community structures, and propagation paths in social media networks.
